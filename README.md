# vnt-emb-ryobot
Robotics proto-project for a self-navigating mobile robot

This is no more than a playground as of its creation date, Tuesday, March 24th, 2020.
Hopefully this playground will bring me to sound(er?) know-how on self-navigating mobile robots.
Been wishing to fiddle with mobile robots for a while now, so what better occasion than a general nation-wide lockdown to start off?
Been wishing to make stuff like this my day-to-day job for a while now, too; so what better way to build some skills than getting my hands dirty with code and maths?
